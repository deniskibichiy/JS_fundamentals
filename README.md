//Arithmetic operators
//let x= 100+50 //literals
//x= a + b //variables
// operand, operator, and operand
//modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder
/*let a=5
let b=2
let z= a%b
console.log(z)
a++
a--
console.log (a)
//Icrement, decrement, exponentiation operators
let a=5
let b=2
let z= a**b
console.log(z)
a++
a--
console.log (a)*/

// Operator predence

let a=100+50*3
console.log(a)
//multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction
let x=(100+50) * 3
console.log(x);
x=100+50-3
let y=100/50+2*125
console.log (y)
console.log(x)// when multiple operators are used together and with the same precedence, such as - and + and * and /, they are evaluated from left to right

// Numbers: only one type of numbers in JS as they can be written either with a decimal or without a decimal.
